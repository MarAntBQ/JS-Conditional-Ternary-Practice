# JS Conditional Ternary Practice

This project is a simple JavaScript practice focused on using **ternary operators** to simplify conditional logic. It allows users to input their age and displays a message indicating whether they are a minor or an adult. The goal is to demonstrate how ternary operators can replace traditional `if-else` statements, making the code cleaner and more concise.

## Features
- Input field for the user's age.
- Button to check the age and display the result.
- Dynamic message displayed using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
- Example of how to use ternary operators for conditional logic.

## How It Works
1. The user enters their age in the input field.
2. By clicking the "Check Age" button, the script evaluates the input using a ternary operator.
3. A message is displayed indicating whether the user is a minor or an adult.
